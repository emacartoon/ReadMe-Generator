## Installation Instructions
 
After you clone down your repo, you will need to install Node.js in your environment. This should be easily achieved with:
 
```
npm i
```
 
To run the generator, use Node to run the index script:
```
node index.js
```
 
Follow the prompts in your Terminal, and a ReadMe.md file will be created in your main folder.
 
## My Usage
 
Run this script when you'd like to generate a consistent already-formatted ReadMe for your GitHub repositories.
  
## Technology Used
 
JavaScript
  
 
  
## Tests
 
If you can read this, this was generated using my generator. Any edits will be mentioned below.
- I formatted the Links afterwards to explain what they go to
- I manually added the video link that I recorded while generating this file
- I manually added the Screenshot below
- I also added a bit more information on the installation, explaining how to run the npm i, etc.
